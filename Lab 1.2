// Alyssa Delgado

#include <iostream>                
using namespace std;

int main ()

{
  
  cout << "--------------------------------" << endl;
  cout<<"Alyssa Delgado"<<endl;
  cout<< "Computer Science 1"<<endl;
  cout<<"Lab 1"<<endl;
  cout<<"January 23, 2023"<<endl;
  cout << "--------------------------------" << endl;
  int number;
  float total;


  cout <<"Today is a great day for lab" << endl;
  cout << endl <<"Let's start off by typin a number of your choice" << endl;
  cin >> number ;

  total = number * 2;
  cout << total << " is twice the number you typed" << endl;

  return 0;
  
}

Question: Yes I feel I am getting valid inputs because when I enter in 9 I get 18 which is twice the number I typed. This is true for any number I tried as well, I get double the number I enter.
