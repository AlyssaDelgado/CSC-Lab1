1. Run the program. (compile and run)
What is the output of the program?
25

2. Try to compile the code again.
Did it compile? If not what kind of error did you get?
I got an error which states error: expected ‘; after expression x=2-

3. Put back the semicolon and try to compile again.
Did it compile?
Yes

4. What kind of output did you get? Were you able to see the values of x and y during the program execution?
Comment out the debugging “cout” statements”
I got content of X right after initialization20
x + Y = 25
content of y right before program exit: 5
which shows they didn't comment it out in this code.

5. Run the program. Did the contents of x and y display during the run of the program?
I only got x + Y = 25 and the content of x and y did not display
